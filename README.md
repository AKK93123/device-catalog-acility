# Public Catalog

The TPX Device Public Catalog Repository contains information about LoRaWAN end-devices, this acts as a key data source for device catalogs and on-boarding devices on LoRaWAN networks.

Under the **vendors** folder, you will find all vendors registered, a changelog.txt with all changes done in this folder and a **README.md** that explains the structure and guide the developer.

This repository is designed to be improved by you! For this, in order to add Devices Profiles, Drivers, etc... You can create a pull request, in **vendors** which will be validated by our team to be published.

Thanks to this, the integrity of the catalog is guaranteed and the experience as well.
