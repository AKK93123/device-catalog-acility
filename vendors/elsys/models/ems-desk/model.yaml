# Commercial name of the model 
name: EMS Desk
# Functional description of the product. Maximum 500 characters. 
description: "The ELSYS EMS Desk is equipped with a body heat sensor (thermopile) for detecting desk occupancy. It also includes a temperature sensor, humidity sensor (for indoor environment monitoring), and accelerometer (for movement detection). The EMS Desk is suitable for applications such as occupancy detection, indoor environment measuring, smart buildings, workplace management, and movement detection. It utilizes LoRaWANÂ® connectivity to transmit data."
