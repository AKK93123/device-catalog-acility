# Commercial name of the model 
name: smart-emitter
# Functional description of the product. Maximum 500 characters. 
description: "The STREGA LoRaWAN Time-controlled Emitter remotely actuates an irrigation valve. With its ultra-low-power consumption, the Smart-Emitter can trigger Open or Close operations of any irrigation valve equipped with a DC latching solenoid. Watering schedulers can be programmed directly at the zone level, avoiding the necessity to use an irrigation controller."
