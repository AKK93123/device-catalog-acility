# Commercial name of the model 
name: Vaqa'O+Plus
# Functional description of the product. Maximum 500 characters. 
description: "The nke WATTECO Vaqa’O+ has sensors for measuring temperature, relative humidity, atmospheric pressure, the concentration of volatile organic compounds (VOC), and carbon dioxide (CO2) in the ambient air of a room in a building, an apartment, or a house. It allows Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) monitoring based on the presence of individuals using luminosity (lighting) and motion (PIR) detection in the room. The data is transmitted via a public or private LoRaWAN® network."
