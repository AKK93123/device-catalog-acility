# Functional description of the product. Maximum 500 characters. 
description: "SENSAiO is a wide range of Industrial intelligent connected devices that converts any conventional assets into an intelligent connected machine located in hazardous et remote locations. Fully autonomous, this device is battery-operated transmitting value by radio communication over Bluetooth™ 5.0 or LoRaWAN™ enabling long transmission ranges and long battery life. The transmission of the measured valve position values can be carried out in a customer-specific IIoT infrastructure while performing advanced analytics at edge and alarm threshold triggering. SENSAiO devices fulfil safety-related requirements of the relevant international standards and regulations for hazardous areas Zone 0/1. This device enables accurate valve position measurement for numerous different applications (e.g Manual valve, Multi-turn, 1/4 turns, actuated valve…)."
