# Commercial name of the model 
name: ed10w
# Functional description of the product. Maximum 500 characters. 
description: "ED10W is a smart IoT watch based on LoRaWAN. Combined with motion sensor, it can achieve indoor and outdoor real-time positioning. With wearing detection, it can realize a real-time collection of health data such as heart rate, body temperature,blood pressure, and steps. The data will be transmitted to the platform through the LoRaWAN Network."
