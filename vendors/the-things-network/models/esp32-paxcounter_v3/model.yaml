# Commercial name of the model 
name: ESP32-Paxcounter
# Functional description of the product. Maximum 500 characters. 
description: "The ESP32-Paxcounter has sensors for battery, GPS, altitude, temperature, humidity, barometer, pm2.5, and pm10. It is an ESP32 MCU-based device for metering passenger flows in real-time. It counts how many mobile devices are around by scanning WiFi and Bluetooth signals in the air and provides an estimation of how many people are around. The captured data is transmitted over a public or private LoRaWANÂ® radio network."
